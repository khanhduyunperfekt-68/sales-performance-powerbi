## Project 1 — Sales Performance Dashboard (Apr 2023–Apr 2025)

**Goal:** Build a monitoring dashboard and quantify key drivers across time, region, segment, and product.

**Tools:** Power BI (DAX & modeling)

**Outputs:** Overview page + Deep Dive page with YoY/MoM and Top-10 profit ranking.

**Insights:** YoY uplift is strong; regions are relatively balanced; profit-based product ranking highlights what to scale.

**Actions:** protect margin with guardrails; scale high-profit products; normalize partial months for fair comparisons.
